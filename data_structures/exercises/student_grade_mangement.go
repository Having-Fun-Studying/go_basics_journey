// Exercise: Student Grade Management System
// Problem Description:

// Create a student grade management system that allows users to interact with a database of student grades.
// The program should allow the user to perform basic operations such as adding a student,
// assigning grades for various subjects, updating grades, calculating average grades,
// and displaying all student grades. The goal is to use control structures,
// functions, arrays, slices, and maps effectively to manage the data and user input.

// Requirements:
// Initial Setup:

// Start with an empty list of students.
// Each student should have a name and a map of subjects with corresponding grades.
// Display a menu with options for the user: Add Student, Assign Grade, Update Grade, Calculate Average Grade, Display All Grades, and Exit.
// Control Structures:

// Use a loop to repeatedly show the menu until the user decides to exit.
// Handle the user's menu selection using control structures like if-else or switch-case.
// Functions:

// Add Student:

// Implement a function to add a new student to the list. The function should prompt the user to enter the student's name.
// Ensure no duplicate student names are allowed.
// Assign Grade:

// Implement a function to assign a grade to a student for a specific subject.
// If the subject doesn't exist for the student, add the subject and the grade to their record.
// Update Grade:

// Implement a function to update an existing grade for a specific subject of a student.
// Calculate Average Grade:

// Implement a function to calculate the average grade for a specific student across all subjects.
// Display All Grades:

// Implement a function to display all students and their grades in all subjects.
// Display Menu:

// Implement a function to display the menu and get the user's choice.
// Variables:

// Maintain a list of students, where each student is represented as a map entry with their name as the key and their subjects and grades as another map.
// Use variables to handle user input and other necessary data for transactions.
// User Interaction:

// The user should be able to repeatedly interact with the system until they choose to exit.
// The user can add students, assign or update grades, calculate averages, or display all grades based on their choice.
// The program should provide feedback on each operation, such as confirming a grade assignment or showing the calculated average.
